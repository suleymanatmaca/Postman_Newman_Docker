# Running Postman Collection using Newman in Docker

Running Postman Collection using Newman in Docker

Prerequisites
-Docker installed on your machine

# Steps
## 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository that contains your Postman collection and environment files:

git clone https://github.com/Sueyman/Postman_Newman_Docker.git

cd Postman_Newman_Docker

## 2. Run the Docker Command

Use the following Docker command to execute the Postman collection using Newman:

# newman:alpine

This image runs newman on node v16 on Alpine

Build the image:

```terminal
docker build -t postman/newman:alpine .
```
Then run it:

```terminal
docker run -dit --volume="../Postman/collections:/etc/newman"  -t postman/newman:ubuntu run products_postman_collection.json -e mock_postman_environment.json -r json --reporter-json-export newman-report.json
```
For newman-docker to be able to use collections and environment files saved on the host machine, and to save reports generated by newman, a directory containing the collection and environment needs to be mounted on to the docker instance on run time, preferably at `/etc/newman`, which is the default working directory. If you mount to a different location, then:
- You can pass the full path to your collection and environment files to newman.

Explanation of the Docker command:

-dit: Detached mode with a pseudo-tty enabled

--volume="../Postman/collections:/etc/newman": Mounts the directory containing the collections to the /etc/newman directory inside the container

-t postman/newman:ubuntu: Specifies the Docker image (you can change the image based on your specific Newman version)

run products_postman_collection.json -e mock_postman_environment.json -r json --reporter-json-export newman-report.json: Runs the Postman collection using Newman with specified collection, environment, and report settings.

## 3. Check Reports
After the execution, check the generated newman-report.json file for the Newman execution report.
